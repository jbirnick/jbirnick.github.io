Hi, I'm Johann.
I'm interested in mathematics and computer science.

Currently I work on quantization and compression of deep neural networks.
I'm also interested in cryptography, in particular in lattice cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and SNARKs.
During my Bachelor and Master studies I was focusing on pure algebraic topics (and logic), and I still enjoy reading about related thing from time to time.

I enjoy to look at applicable things, such as (practical) algorithms.
**I like to combine elegant theory with useful practice.**

If time allows, one day I would like to learn more about hardware, chemistry, biology, and neuroscience.

Feel free to contact me via \[firstname\].\[lastname\]@hotmail.de ([PGP Public Key](pgp-public-key.asc)), I'm always happy to speak about math, computer science, engineering, life, and everything else.
