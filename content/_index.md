Hi, I'm Johann. I'm interested in mathematics and computer science.
More concretely, here is a list with some of my interests, roughly ordered by their usefulness in the real world / industry (which is also roughly the order in which I became interested in them):

- arithmetic geometry and its applications to cryptography (& coding theory)
  * algebraic and elliptic curves
  * $p$-adics, and analogs for (complex-)analytic notions over them
  * some algebraic geometry, like Galois Theory of schemes yielding a relation between Galois groups and fundamental groups
  * (automorphic forms, Galois representations, their relation to algebraic/geometric objects, noncommutative geometry, quaternion algebras)
  * computational aspects of all the previous and computer algebra
- the language(s) of mathematics and computer science
  * applying category theory to commputer science, data science, engineering, logic, and other sciences
  * interactive proof assistants and automatic theorem proving, as well as formal verification of software, and combining computer algebra with formal verification of proofs
- applied mathematics, optimization, data science
  * probability and statistics
  * all sorts of (at the time I prefer continuous) optimization, also in combination with probability/statistics
  * machine learning
- artificial intelligence

Over the last three years, breaking elliptic curve based cryptography has been a great motivation for me to learn about arithmetic geometry.
That's where I learned about the first block above.

Recently, I (re)broadened my energy to also look into applied math, computer science, and computational engineering.
**I like to combine elegant theory with useful practice.**

If time allows (not right now, of course!), I would also be interested in an engineering project outside of my "comfort zone", for example involving biotech, chemisty, or mechanical engineering.

If you are at ETH, please have a look at the [undergraduate colloquium](https://zucmap.ethz.ch/), which I have (re)initiated together with Sidd!

Feel free to contact me via firstname.lastname@hotmail.de ([PGP Public Key](pgp-public-key.asc)), I'm always happy to speak about math, computer science, engineering, life, and everything else.
