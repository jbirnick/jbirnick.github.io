Hi, I'm Johann.
I'm interested in mathematics and computer science.
More concretely, here is a list with some of my interests, roughly ordered by their usefulness in the real world / industry:

- (some aspects of arithmetic geometry and computer algebra)
- real algebraic geometry and toposes (and relation to optimization)
- applications of algebraic geometry and algebra (e.g. tensors)
- modern high-dimensional/computational/robust statistics/learning/information theory/geometry
- cryptanalysis, especially related to lattices
- optimization
- (computational) optimal transport and applications
- machine learning
- artificial intelligence

A big part of my mathematics education was motivated by logic and cryptanalysis.
I enjoy to look at applicable things, such as (ideally practical) algorithms.

**I like to combine elegant theory with useful practice.**

If time allows, one day I would like to learn more about biology and neuroscience.

Feel free to contact me via \[firstname\].\[lastname\]@hotmail.de ([PGP Public Key](pgp-public-key.asc)), I'm always happy to speak about math, computer science, engineering, life, and everything else.
