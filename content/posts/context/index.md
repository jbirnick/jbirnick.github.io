In the mathematical community, typesetting is almost always done with [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX).
However, there is a superior alternative called [ConTeXt](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/) that almost nobody has heard of.
Most things, including mathematical syntax, are the same; and what it does differently, it usually does better.
Most importantly, it provides much more options to adjust the design of all aspects of the document.
In this post, I wish to introduce you to ConTeXt and show you how to make the switch.

## TL;DR

- ConTeXt is a typesetting system based on TeX, just like LaTeX
- the syntax is pretty similar to LaTeX, so switching is easy
- many things are designed much better, which makes switching worthwhile
- yes, you can submit ConTeXt papers to the arXiv!

## Examples

here is fdsf how does fsd srender btw

The minimal ConTeXt file is `this` jo:

```tex
\setuppapersize[A4]
\setuplayout[
  topspace=20mm,
  backspace=20mm,
  width=middle,
  height=270mm,
  footerdistance=11mm,
  footer=2mm]
```
