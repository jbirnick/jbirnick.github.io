I'm a math student interested in number theory, arithmetic geometry, and computational aspects of the previous.
Currently I do Part III in Cambridge, before that I've been at ETH Zurich.
At this point, apart from Algebraic Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry in general, I'm particularly interested in:

- Modular/Automorphic Forms and their correspondence to algebraic & geometric objects
- Algebraic+Elliptic Curves, from all perspectives
- quaternion algebras & similar:
  * noncommutative geometry
  * shimura curves attached to them
  * Jacquetâ€“Langlands correspondence
- Galois Theory of schemes, relation between Galois groups and fundamental groups
- p-adic methods, and analogues for (complex-)analytic notions in this setting (like integration)
- Galois representations and their role in the Langlands Program

Before that, I was doing computer science.
I like explicit and computational aspects of number theory / arithmetic geometry, and also cryptography.
In fact, breaking elliptic curve based cryptography has been a great motivation for me to learn about the things mentioned above.
Formally verifiable proofs are also a neat thing.
Though I don't actively work in that field, I wonder about their foundations, how they can help for *finding* proofs or understanding them, and how they can be combined with computational math.

If you are at ETH, please have a look at the [undergraduate colloquium](https://zucmap.ethz.ch/), which I have (re)initiated together with Sidd!

**I am looking for a PhD position from summer 2023.**
