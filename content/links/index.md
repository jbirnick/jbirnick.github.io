On this page I collect links to useful webpages, nice people, and other things.

## Software

- See [my GitHub](https://github.com/jbirnick) for a few programming projects I've made publicly available.
- For typesetting, ~~I currently use and recommend [ConTeXt](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/) (over LaTeX), but I very much look forward to start using [Typst](https://typst.app/)~~. I have switched to Typst, and it's amazing. See [my former blog post on this](/posts/typesetting-comparison/).
- For making the pictures in my posts, I use the amazing software [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), together with my Wacom Pen Tablet (Intuos M).
- For writing digitally (online lectures, slides, ...), I use [Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/) with my Wacom tablet.
- Recently, I became a [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) contributor.
- For reading PDFs, [Sioyek](https://sioyek.info/) can be helpful (though it has minor bugs).
- If you organize something where you need people to sign contracts/waivers, consider [DocuSeal](https://docuseal.co/).

## Conferences / Programs / Meetings

I now maintain a list of events in my rough area(s) of interest, which is found [here](/conferences/).

If you are looking for the old arithmetic geometry conference list, this is now [here](/conferences/numbertheory/).

## People

- [Siddharth Setlur](https://siddharthsetlur.github.io/) is a friend of mine with whom I have (re)build the [Zurich Undergraduate Colloquium in Mathematics and Physics](https://zucmap.ethz.ch/).
- [Julian Lyczak](https://www.julianlyczak.nl/) is an amazing advisor, who taught me about the Brauer-Manin obstruction during my [internship at IST Austria](https://phd.pages.ist.ac.at/isternship/).
- [William Dudarov](https://sites.google.com/view/william-dudarov/) is an amazing guy I've met at PCMI 2022.
