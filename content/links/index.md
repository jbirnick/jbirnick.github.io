On this page I collect links to useful webpages, nice people, and other things.

## Software

- See [my GitHub](https://github.com/jbirnick) for a few programming projects I've made publicly available.
- For typesetting, I can very much recommend [Typst](https://typst.app/) (over LaTeX). See [my former blog post on this](/posts/typesetting-comparison/).
- For making the pictures in my posts, I use the amazing software [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), together with my Wacom Pen Tablet (Intuos M).
- If you want to insert LaTeX/Typst formulas into Inkscape, use [TexText](https://github.com/textext/textext).
- For writing digitally (online lectures, slides, ...), I use [Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/) with my Wacom tablet, but I've heard nowadays people use [Rnote](https://rnote.flxzt.net/).
- As a Computer Algebra System, I recommend [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/).
- For reading PDFs, [Sioyek](https://sioyek.info/) can be helpful (though it has minor bugs).
- When you ask people to sign contracts/waivers, consider [DocuSeal](https://www.docuseal.co/).
- If you are looking for a place to backup your files, check out [rsync.net](https://www.rsync.net/cloudstorage.html).
  If you are looking for a tool to create the backups, including encryption, check out [Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/).
  Also rsync.net has a [very good offer](https://www.rsync.net/products/borg.html) for borg users.

## Conferences / Programs / Meetings

I now maintain a list of events in my rough area(s) of interest, which is found [here](/conferences/).

If you are looking for the old arithmetic geometry conference list, this is now [here](/conferences/numbertheory/).

## People

- [Siddharth Setlur](https://siddharthsetlur.github.io/) is a friend of mine with whom I have (re)build the [Zurich Undergraduate Colloquium in Mathematics and Physics](https://zucmap.ethz.ch/).
- [Julian Lyczak](https://www.julianlyczak.nl/) is an amazing advisor, who taught me about the Brauer-Manin obstruction during my [internship at IST Austria](https://phd.pages.ist.ac.at/isternship/).
- [William Dudarov](https://sites.google.com/view/william-dudarov/) is an amazing guy I've met at PCMI 2022.
